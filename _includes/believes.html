        <h2>LIVE CODE AND LET CODE LIVE</h2>
        <p>Our motivation stems from the belief that strengthening Python's role in creative self-expression enhances its appeal. By integrating Python into music creation, we tap into the universal language of music, connecting with people on a profound level.</p>
        <p>This initiative aims to stimulate engagement with Python and programming, particularly among young people. Recognizing the significant role music plays in shaping identities, we believe this event will bring individuals into contact with Python and its vibrant community, fostering a sense of belonging and collaboration.</p>
