#### CtrlReturn >> Jam&Learn No. 2

In our second meetup, we had a workshop with  Elie Gavoty, who showed how to
make Renardo ready to record each of the synths/sample player as separate
stereo channel.

Elie is Developer of Renardo, and joined online via Jitsi.

Afterwards, we did some jamming (more or less :D) >> Video above

*For all who want to try live coding, bring just your laptop with you next time!*

*You do not need to install anything to try, as the laptop connect to the sound system takes on that job.*
