#### CtrlReturn >> Jam&Learn No. 3

<img src="files/jamnlearn_3.jpg" alt="JamNLearn3" width="720">

Our third meeting went down with a great jam session and first visuals via Hydra.
However, we had some trouble making flok working for us. We still need to figure
sound responding FFT in this setup. It does not work yet.

We also had some problems to get our online participants.
