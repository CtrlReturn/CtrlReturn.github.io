#### CtrlReturn >> Jam&Learn No. 8

Happy New Year 2025 to all lively coders!

In the first meetup in this year, we rather hang on installing FoxDot/Renardo on Windows OS machines.
We successful got it to work with three conclusions:

1. Using following command avoids installing pip on Windows

    `py -m pip install renardo`

    However, you'll need to use following code line to run renardo:

    `python -m renardo`

2. The manual installation documentation for Windows needs a proper update on our Renardo project site.

3. An automatic batch executable (e.g. setup.exe) for Windows users is needed.
