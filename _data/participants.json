    "bio": "Nabìr is the solo project of Rome-based audio + visual artist
            Lorenzo Berretti. Nabìr employs live coding on TidalCycles and
            SuperCollider with handmade cassette tape loops to create
            imaginative soundscapes and nostalgic atmospheres. Both the music
            and the visuals are conceived as a warm and welcoming hug, a flood
            of memories that passes through the lenses of digital and computer
            manipulation. A merging of the old and the new, where the boundaries
            between these dimensions are blurred through the recontextualisation
            of live coding, cassettes, vhs, sampling, field recording, and
            looping. These compositions blur the genres of IDM, ambient, drone,
            and electronic music.

            In his short career he has already participated to numerous events:
            -Opening to Dario Rossi @ Parco Appio (Roma)
