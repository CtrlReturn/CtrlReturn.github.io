### WORKSHOP

FoxDot is an easy-to-use Python library that creates an interactive programming
environment and talks to the powerful sound synthesis engine, called SuperCollider
to make music.

FoxDot schedules musical events in a user-friendly and easy-to-grasp manner that
makes live coding easy and fun for both programming newcomers and veterans alike.

Workshop is momentarily available in English and in German.

## BIO
<br>
>Movement is life, balance is not a fixed point.
>Confusion is an unknown path.
>Experiments lead to clarity.
>Chaos creates patterns.

Beside my work as an Artist, I would like to share my gained skills and knowledge
with teachers, students and kids.
That is why I created workshops which I offer to people and institutions as
teaching tools and content that can be freely modified through its
open-source nature.
