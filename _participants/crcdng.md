### WORKSHOP

This workshop will describe a robust, practical Livecoding setup developed over
a number of events in the last 2 years that allows to play full-screen
audiovisual shows using TidalCycles, Hydra and flok.

I will cover my technical setup in depth and discuss practical issues such as
using flok for a full-screen experience, audio interfaces, sample management,
audio setup in Supercollider, integrating Hydra with Text, 3D, Images and Video
and MIDI communication between TidalCycles and Hydra.

Further topics are Livecoding without WIFI at the venue and OBS setup for
streaming events. And I will share mistakes and learnings from streaming to
a number of TopLap events and live performances at Silent Green, PAS and Ohm.

Participants should get a good understanding of issues and apply learnings
to their own setups.
