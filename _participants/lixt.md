## BIO
<br>
lixt is the documented path of Rafael Bresciani’s research through the use of
live coding as a medium for artistic expression in the digital age.

In the historical moment where human living experience is more and more mediated
by digital and computational environments, Bresciani turned his attention to the
relevance of language as a vector to understand the impact of the mediation of
human living experiences by digital systems.

Former journalist, composer and sound designer and with a masters in Net Art and
Digital Culture, Bresciani devote his efforts to better understand and discuss
the characteristics and consequences of the massive interaction between man and
machine to identify the changing of our times.

I have just applied with a set of mine: [sh[i]e[l]d].
