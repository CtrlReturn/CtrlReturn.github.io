## BIO
<br>
Jaxa is the pseudonym of an Argentine composer based in Berlin who finds the
custom of writing biographies in the third person peculiar, especially
considering that they are likely self-written by the composer.

My work spans diverse musical genres, encompassing traditional instrumental
music and electronic compositions.

Born in Buenos Aires, I initially studied Music Composition before undertaking
postgraduate studies in music in London. Adopting the name Jaxa for live coding,
an activity I have started three years ago, my performances make use
SuperCollider to explore synthetic textures, emphasising the role of
noises and rhythmic components.
