### PERFORMANCE

Like deep pads, latin and other killer rhythms and computer jazz. I play a kind
of ambient techno/footwork music involving melodical/bass lines sometimes
mainstream sometimes crazy free-jazzey.

## BIO
<br>
I'm a music live-coder, performing and organizing concerts as part of the Paris
based Cookie Collective.

I'm also part of several other music projects and have been involved in
free software for years (especially Yunohost).

Now I would like to keep develop new livecoding community tools based on
Renardo/FoxDot and Hydra and start growing vegetables.
