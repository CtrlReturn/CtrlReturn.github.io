## BIO
<br>
Bito is an itinerant live coder exploring the vast possibilities of live coding
systems. He is always on the look for surprising technology combinations, and
likes expressing himself through heavy and distorted riff inspired sounds,
industrial, noise and breakcore; with a pinch melodic soundscapes here and there.
