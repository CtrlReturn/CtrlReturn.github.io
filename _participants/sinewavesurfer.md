## BIO
<br>
Anselm Weber applied for music informatics at the University of Music in
Karlsruhe, due to his interest in contemporary music.

In the course of his studies, he performed more and more pieces both as a
composer and as a performer.

Since his first contact with the live coding scene in Karlsruhe, Anselm Weber
has developed a passion for live coding. First in the audience and now on stage
in various constellations and contexts.

Jakob Schreiber studies music informatics at the Institute for Music Informatics
and Musicology at the Karlsruhe University of Music.

He performs as a live musician, composes works with electronics and explores
the materiality of digital technologies.

Live coding accompanies most of his works, whether in the form of an auditory
starting point or as a visible stage practice.
