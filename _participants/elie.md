### WORKSHOP

Renardo introduction (beginners) and/or renardo new features presentation for
FoxDot users (fade ninja based composition, reaper and VST plugin integration)

---

## BIO
<br>
I'm a music livecoder, performing and organizing concerts as part of the Paris
based Cookie Collective.

I'm also part of several other music projects and have been involved in
free software for years (especially Yunohost).

Now I would like to keep develop new livecoding community tools based on
Renardo/FoxDot and Hydra and start growing vegetables.
