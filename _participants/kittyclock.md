## BIO
<br>
Emerging from the foggy depths of Prague's underground scene, KittyClock is utilizing
FoxDot, SuperCollider, and Hydra to craft his audiovisual experiments.

His sound is a relentless fusion of industrial heaviness and experimental noise,
where thunderous, machine-like rhythms meet stark, glitched-out visuals.

He's forging an auditory onslaught that challenges the senses, enveloping listeners
in a soundscape where the boundary between man and machine blurs into obscurity.

He is also the organizer of the biggest FoxDot community channel on Telegram.
Many people with the same passion found each other through this information hub.

#### And KittyClock got a surprise for this event in his sleeves! Miaowww ;-D
